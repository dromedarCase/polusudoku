# How to Start
  Head over to <https://dromedarcase.github.io/polusudoku/polusudoku.svg>. You'll need an SVG and JavaScript enabled browser. You
  can also grab 'polusudoku.svg' and place it somewhere your browser can access it.

# The Rules
  You compare the numbers adjacent to each circle and write a greater-than-, less-than- or equals-sign, according to the result of
  your comparision into the circle. Don't take it too seriously. You're probably to old for this. ;)
